For teams:

We agree to the following policies for our team. Once agreed to, these policies cannot be changed for the duration of the project unless agreed to via the decision-making process outlined below.

-

Team roles. Any specific roles within the group, their responsibilities, and how those roles will be assigned or rotated.

	We will be alternating team roles between assignments to insure fairness and equivalent amount of time spent on work.

Decision making. For example: consensus, majority vote, or team captain.

	As a pair, we will both consult with each other before making any significant changes to the project.

Balance of responsibilities. Procedures for ensuring that everyone contributes.
	
	We will tally up hours per week to make sure equivalent effort is achieved. We will also meet early in the week to discuss division of tasks for project.

Conflict resolution. What we will do when we identify problems, and how we will resolve them.

	We will discuss and communicate	such to our partner in a respectful manner.

Communication. Methods of communication, expectations for response times.

	We will use FaceTime / zoom, text, and email .

Meeting times. When and where you will meet, expectations for attendance. (Study hall could be a great meeting place...) Be sure to take into account the schedule of project phase deadlines, as well as everyone's course schedules, exams, other projects, and commitments beyond coursework.

	We will be trying to keep our schedule of meeting around 3:30 Monday, Wednesday, Friday to check in, as 	
	typically have a longer work time together on Sunday. We will make an effort to communicate schedule conflicts 	
	early on. 

Availability. When each member will not be available for any reason, and how you will work around these absences.

	We will communicate to each other in advance and work around it.
